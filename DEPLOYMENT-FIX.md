# GitHub Actions Deployment Fix

## Current Status
✅ Namespaces and secrets are being created successfully
❌ No pods deployed because builds/pushes haven't completed yet

## Next Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Actions Status
Go to: https://github.com/bleetmaa/trailer-rent/actions
- Verify build jobs are completing successfully
- Check if images are being pushed to GitHub Container Registry

### 2. Trigger a Test Deployment

Push a small change to trigger the workflow:

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Deployment test $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test GitHub Actions deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Monitor the Workflow

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Watch the workflow progress:
   - ✅ Backend tests
   - ✅ Frontend tests  
   - ✅ Build and push backend image
   - ✅ Build and push frontend image
   - ✅ Deploy to production

### 4. Check Deployment Status

After the workflow completes, check your cluster:

```bash
# Check pods
kubectl get pods -n trailer-rent-prod

# Check services
kubectl get svc -n trailer-rent-prod

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n trailer-rent-prod

# Check logs if needed
kubectl logs -l app=backend -n trailer-rent-prod
kubectl logs -l app=frontend -n trailer-rent-prod
```

## If GitHub Actions Still Fails

The timeout error suggests your KUBE_CONFIG secret might need the right endpoint. 

**Check your demo-notes repository secrets:**
1. Go to your demo-notes repo → Settings → Secrets
2. Compare the KUBE_CONFIG secret with your current one
3. The server URL in the kubeconfig might be different

**Generate correct KUBE_CONFIG:**
```bash
# On k8s-master
kubectl config view --raw --minify | base64 -w 0
```

## Working Demo-Notes Pattern

Since your demo-notes worked with GitHub Actions, copy that exact pattern:
1. Same KUBE_CONFIG format
2. Same network/DNS setup that allowed external access
3. Same cluster endpoint configuration

The workflow is already configured correctly with `--insecure-skip-tls-verify` flags!
