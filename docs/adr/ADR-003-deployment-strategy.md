# ADR-003: Deployment and DevOps Strategy

**Date**: 2025-07-17
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: DevOps Team

## Context
We need to establish a robust deployment strategy for the trailer rental platform that supports multiple environments, provides reliable CI/CD, and enables easy rollbacks using GitOps principles.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive DevOps strategy using:

### Container Orchestration
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform
- **Docker**: Containerization of both frontend and backend
- **Multi-environment setup**: DEV, QA, PROD with namespace isolation

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated build, test, and deployment
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Docker image storage
- **Automated testing**: Unit tests for both backend and frontend
- **Security scanning**: Container vulnerability scanning

### GitOps Deployment
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous deployment
- **Kustomize**: Environment-specific configuration management
- **Automated sync**: Self-healing deployments with automatic rollback

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Kubernetes manifests**: Declarative infrastructure definition
- **Environment-specific configurations**: DEV/QA/PROD customization
- **Secret management**: Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data

## Deployment Flow

### Development Process
1. Developer pushes code to feature branch
2. GitHub Actions runs tests and builds images
3. Pull request review and merge to develop
4. Automatic deployment to DEV environment via ArgoCD
5. QA testing in DEV environment
6. Merge to main branch triggers PROD deployment

### Environment Progression
- **DEV**: `develop` branch → `dev.trailerrent.se`
- **QA**: Manual promotion → `qa.trailerrent.se`  
- **PROD**: `main` branch → `trailerrent.se`

### Rollback Strategy
- **ArgoCD**: Automatic rollback on failed health checks
- **Git-based**: Easy rollback by reverting Git commits
- **Database**: Backup and migration strategies

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Secrets Required
- `KUBE_CONFIG`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig file
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `KUBERNETES_PUBLIC_IP`: Cluster public IP address

### Kubernetes Resources
- **Namespaces**: trailer-rent-dev, trailer-rent-qa, trailer-rent-prod
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent database with PVC storage
- **Ingress**: External access with SSL termination
- **Secrets**: JWT keys and database credentials

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Health checks**: Application liveness and readiness probes
- **Logging**: Centralized log aggregation
- **Metrics**: Application and infrastructure monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Automated deployments**: Reduced manual errors and faster releases
- **Environment consistency**: Identical configuration across environments
- **Easy rollbacks**: Quick recovery from failed deployments
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes enables horizontal scaling
- **Security**: Secret management and network policies
- **GitOps**: Infrastructure and application state in Git

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Learning curve for Kubernetes and ArgoCD
- **Initial setup**: Time investment for pipeline configuration
- **Resource overhead**: Additional infrastructure components required

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Regular security updates for base images
- Kubernetes cluster maintenance and upgrades
- Database backup and disaster recovery procedures
- Performance monitoring and optimization
