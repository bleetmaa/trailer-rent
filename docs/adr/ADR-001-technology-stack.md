# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Date**: 2025-07-17
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context
We need to select a technology stack for building a professional trailer rental platform with the following requirements:
- Modern web application with authentication
- 3-tier architecture
- Multi-environment deployment (DEV/QA/PROD)
- Cloud-native and scalable
- Strong typing and maintainability

## Decision
We have decided to use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Angular 17+**: Modern SPA framework with TypeScript
- **Angular Material**: Consistent UI components
- **RxJS**: Reactive programming for data handling

### Backend  
- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**: Enterprise-grade web API framework
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for database operations
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication mechanism

### Database
- **PostgreSQL 15**: Robust, open-source relational database

### Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps deployment tool

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong typing throughout the stack (TypeScript + C#)
- Excellent tooling and IDE support
- Enterprise-grade security and performance
- Great community support and documentation
- Scalable and maintainable architecture

### Negative  
- Learning curve for developers new to these technologies
- More complex setup compared to simpler stacks
- Requires understanding of multiple technologies

## Alternatives Considered
- **Node.js + TypeScript**: Rejected due to preference for C# backend
- **React**: Rejected in favor of Angular's comprehensive framework approach
- **MySQL**: Rejected in favor of PostgreSQL's advanced features
